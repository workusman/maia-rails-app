# Maia

Maia is a candidate re-marketing platform for employers. We capture people who visit career sites but donâ€™t apply for jobs, then automatically engage them with the employer. Maia improves advertising ROI by helping employers hire candidates they normally lose.

# How to test
Maia backend api is hosted at https://maia-rails-app.herokuapp.com/
For testing, please use these two pages. The Maia Pop-up is integrated here and working as expected:
1) http://my-maia.surge.sh/
2) http://maia-feel.surge.sh/

# Following are the steps to get Maia up and running on your Local Env

* Run `bundle install`

* Run `rake db:create`

* Run `rake db:migrate`

* Run `rails s`

# Assumptions
1. Maia Stores The email address of a visitor in Browser Local Storage for future use.
2. No Authentication is required for now for clients.
3. By leaving client site, it means a visitor is moving outside the DOM (Browser Page).
